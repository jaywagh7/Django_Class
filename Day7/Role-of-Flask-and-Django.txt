Role of Flask and Django:

* Flask and Django are both popular Python web frameworks, but they different in their design philosophies and complexity.
 Flask is a microframework that is simple and lightweight, making it suitable for small-scale applications and prototypes. 
 It provides flexibility and allows developers to choose the components they need.
* Django, on the other hand, is a full-stack framework that includes everything needed to build web applications out of the
 box. It follows the "batteries-included" philosophy, providing a set of components for common web development tasks such
  as authentication, routing, and templating.
