Difference between an App and a Project:

* In Django, a project is a collection of settings for an instance of Django, including database configuration, 
Django-specific options, and application-specific settings. It represents a complete web application.
* A project is typically the top-level directory that contains all the files and directories needed for a 
Django application to run.
* a project's default file names include settings.py (for project settings), urls.py (for URL patterns), 
wsgi.py (for WSGI deployment), asgi.py (for ASGI deployment), manage.py (for project management)
* An application is typically designed to serve a specific purpose or feature within a project, and can include models,
 views, templates, and static files.
* In a Django app, the default file names include init.py (for package recognition), models.py (for database models), 
views.py (for view functions), admin.py (for admin interface registration), and apps.py (for app configuration).
