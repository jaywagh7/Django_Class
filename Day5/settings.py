'''
Middleware in Django is like a bridge that sits between the Django request/response cycle. 
It processes requests before they reach your views and responses before they are sent to the client.
Think of it as a way to hook into Django's request/response cycle to modify or process data.

Common Uses of Middleware:
Authentication - Verify if a user is logged in.
Session Management - Manage user sessions.
Logging - Track requests and responses.
Security Enhancements - Add headers or protect against common vulnerabilities.
Custom Processing - Modify requests or responses for specific needs.

How Middleware Works:
A request comes into Django.
The middleware stack processes it top-down.
The view processes the request and returns a response.
The middleware stack processes the response bottom-up.
